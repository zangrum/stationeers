### Starter Greenhouse
You need food!  Time for the starter Greenhouse.  This is a semi self contained building.  Its starter air supply and water supply will be piped from Core Base or Life Support once its up and running.  

#### Prep (Optional)
You might want to make it easier to build by putting everything in Crates for each section of the build.  A few container mounts will protect your containers during a storm.

#### The building
This is a 3 by 5 building, two stories tall, with an airlock.  The I is the input for water and air.
*Mine:  Steel(66 Iron, 22 Coal), 47 Silicon, 26 Iron, 6 Copper
