# Upgrade Base
Its time to stop squatting in the dark, and throwing your stuff on the floor!
We are going to take our 8 tile iron base, double its size and convert it to Steel and Composites.  Empty your base of air and replace all the floor markers with Closed Steel Frames.  Then you can build the rest of the structure Around the frames and working base.
