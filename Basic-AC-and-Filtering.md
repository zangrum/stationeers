### Basic AC & Filtering

!!! DONT DO THIS!!!! 
It eventually starts popping pipes and letting your environment mix with the world environment.  I lost an entire save trying to recover from this.  DON'T put pipes with gases that can turn liquid into and out of your base.

Time to make some automated heating and cooling.  We will be extending our previous AC setup, using active vents, radiators and the furnace for this.
