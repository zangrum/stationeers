# Starter Green Corner
You need food!  Time for the Starter Green Corner.   This gives you a few plants in your main base...  You will have to manually monitor temp and pressure or you will KILL your plants.  You need to get the temp to 25+/-5 Degrees and the pressure to 75+/-25kPa. To cool and bring up pressure, throw Ice (Oxite) on the floor.  To start heating close valve V, open valve EV. To Stop heating reverse, close valve EV, open valve V.  If your furnace runs out of heat, Light it.  You will have to manually turn on and off the Grow Light with the rising/setting of the sun.  

AC Room layout. The AC room EV will attach with the extra pipes to the output of the furnace.  For better furnace venting you will want all insulated pipes until you hit the valve to your exhaust stack.  This is a map of the 9 tiles of 2 walls in the AC corner and the 3 tiles on each corner of the walls, you will leave the bottom story empty and put the furnace radiator on the top floor wall. EV: Valve attached to Insulated Pipe coming from outside your base,V: One way valve towards the EPV,  (R): Radiator on an Insulated Pipe, IC: Insulated Pipe Corner, EPV: Exterior Passive Vent, EP: Exterior Pipe, EPC: Exterior Pipe Corner
