### Automate Power
In order to start automating power you need a variety of ores.  Make sure you get the big 3 Iron, Copper and Gold. And trace elements of Lead, Silver, Coal. Spend a long mining trip.  

[Here](IC10/Starter/Generator-Starter-SolarControl.ic10) is a link to the Solar Panel control script.  It assumes you put your daylight sensor between your solar panels with its plug on the same line as the data line.  This Starter version will automate your Green Corner grow light as well.
