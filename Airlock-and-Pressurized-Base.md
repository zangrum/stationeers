# Airlock & a fully pressurized base
Time to upgrade your airlock and keep your base pressurized.  You will be replacing your manual door with an composite door.  I recommend keeping the Pipe Canister with Multiple MPa of Breathable air on the inside of your airlock instead of venting to your base.  It makes the airlock MUCH faster.  !!!WARNING!!! Your base temperature is NOT controlled.  You must manually monitor it, the pieces for Manually operated temperature radiator are in the Starter Green Corner section.  Your power is not yet sustainable.  Turn off your airlock when your not going thru it.
