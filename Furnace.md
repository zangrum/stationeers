# Furnace
Okay its time to start working your way up the tech tree.  First expand your deck and build your furnace on it.  Use the pipes to turn down then sideways,  put a one way valve turn away from you and shoot off.  Put the 3rd Iron Frame as a mount point for the passive vent.  At this point you can disassemble the arc furnace. A: Autolathe, P: Pipe Bender, ALG: Airlock & Gas Canister, F:Furnace, #:Floor
